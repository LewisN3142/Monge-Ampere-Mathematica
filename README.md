# Monge-Ampere-Mathematica
A collection of Mathematica scripts used to perform symbolic computations and generate graphics associated with the Monge&ndash;Ampère geometry arising in incompressible fluid dynamical flows. 
This includes examples of the Pfaffian, Lychagin&ndash;Rubtsov metric, and their pullbacks to solutions in flows corresponding to the Taylor&ndash;Green vortex and Hill's spherical vortices.
Many of these graphics appear in my [paper](https://lewisn3142.github.io/academia_page/academia_docs/Geometry_Vortices_Paper.pdf)  Monge&ndash;Ampère Geometry and Vortices, written alongside Volodya Rubtsov (Angers), Ian Roulstone, and Martin Wolf (both Surrey).
