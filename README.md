# Monge-Ampere-Mathematica
A collection of Mathematica scripts used to perform symbolic computations and generate graphics associated with the Monge&ndash;Ampère geometry arising in incompressible fluid dynamical flows. 
This includes examples of the Pfaffian, Lychagin&ndash;Rubtsov metric, and their pullbacks to solutions in flows corresponding to the Taylor&ndash;Green vortex and Hill's spherical vortices.
Much of the material here appears in either my [thesis](https://lewisn3142.github.io/academia_page/academia_docs/PhD_Thesis.pdf) or the [paper](https://lewisn3142.github.io/academia_page/academia_docs/Geometry_Vortices_Paper.pdf)  Monge&ndash;Ampère Geometry and Vortices, written alongside Volodya Rubtsov (Angers), Ian Roulstone, and Martin Wolf (both Surrey).

In order to run the scripts contained in these notebook files, you will need:
 - Wolfram Mathematica and a corresponding license ([link](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/index.php.en))
 - A TeX distribution, such as MikTeX ([link](https://miktex.org/))
 - Ghostscript ([link](https://www.ghostscript.com/))
 - The MaTeX package for Mathematica ([link](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/MaTeXInstall/))

These should be installed in the order listed and instructions for doing so can be found at the corresponding links. 
The software that is required in addition to the base mathematica package allows the graphs to have labels written in LaTeX, including support for greek characters, subscripts, etc.
